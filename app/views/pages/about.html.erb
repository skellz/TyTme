<h4>Today you may see someone who needs help. Take the time to remember. Tommorrow, that could be me.</h4>
<p align="left">I have always wanted to do more to help others, whether it be donating time, money, goods or just advice. Then I read <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/worst-charities-non-profits-spend-most-their-money-fundraising-1298829">this article</a> about the charity scam, where so many popular charities give less than 10% of their received donations directly to their cause. This left me feeling very angry, like all my life I've been lied to. All the money I thought was going to a good cause was actually just paying for some guys 2nd vaction home.</p><br>
<p align="left">Not wanting to completely abandon supporting good causes I wondered what can I do to make a difference. If charities accepted the item they need to provide help there wouldn't be a concern of where the money is actually going. If a charity does truly want to help others they would gladly accept the product they claim to use for their cause.</p><br>
<p align="left">Today You Tomorrow Me allows charities to create wishlists with items they need to provide help for their cause. Users can then purchase these items directly instead of blindly giving money. With this new form of giving we can help eliminate some of the greed/scam mentality of creating fake charitable orginizations</p>
